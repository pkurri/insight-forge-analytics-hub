## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the system handle conflicting feedback from different users on similar questions?

The conversation memory system resolves conflicting feedback through several mechanisms:

- **Statistical Aggregation**: For similar questions, the system aggregates feedback scores and weights them based on recency and consistency. This prevents outlier feedback from overly influencing the system.

- **Context-Specific Learning**: The `conversation_memory.py` service tracks feedback with context markers, distinguishing between different domains/datasets. This allows the system to learn that a response might be appropriate in one context but not another.

- **Feedback Categorization**: By capturing specific improvement areas (accuracy, clarity, relevance, etc.), the system can identify exactly where conflicts occur rather than just seeing opposing overall ratings.

- **Continuous Improvement Loop**: When conflicts arise, the system triggers additional evaluations using OpenEvals, which can objectively assess both versions against criteria and select the most technically accurate response.

### Are there any performance concerns with running automatic evaluations on every response?

Yes, there are potential performance considerations that we've addressed:

- **Configurable Evaluation Frequency**: The system allows toggling automatic evaluation on/off or adjusting how often it runs (e.g., every 3rd response or only for certain query types).

- **Asynchronous Evaluation**: Crucially, evaluations run asynchronously with a slight delay (1 second timeout), so they don't block the main user interaction flow.

- **Progressive Enhancement**: The evaluation results appear after the response is already displayed, enhancing the UI progressively rather than delaying the initial response.

- **Caching**: Common evaluations are cached to avoid redundant processing for similar responses.

### How will this affect the response latency for users?

The implementation prioritizes user experience:

- **Non-blocking Architecture**: Evaluations and improvements happen in background tasks that don't block the main response flow.

- **Streaming Responses**: The chat interface shows responses as they come in, regardless of evaluation status.

- **Progressive UI Updates**: Quality indicators and improvement buttons appear after evaluations complete, without disrupting the existing response.

- **Batched Operations**: Multiple evaluations are batched when possible to reduce API overhead.

The actual response latency increase for users should be negligible, as the main response flow isn't dependent on evaluation completion.

### Is it easy to customize the scoring system or add new evaluation dimensions?

Absolutely! The system is designed for extensibility:

- **Configurable Evaluation Types**: In the `openevals_config.py` file, you can easily add new evaluation categories by extending the `EvaluationCategory` enum.

- **Customizable Thresholds**: Each category has configurable thresholds that can be adjusted through the API endpoints at `/project-eval/customize/threshold`.

- **Component-Specific Criteria**: Different component types can have different evaluation criteria sets through `/project-eval/customize/criteria`.

- **Evaluation Prompt Templates**: The evaluation prompts are templated and can be modified to include additional dimensions or scoring criteria.

- **Pluggable Evaluators**: The architecture supports adding new evaluator types by extending the base classes and registering them with the service.
